<p>Mixed model 은 오랜동안 통계학 분야에서 사용되어 왔다. 예를들어, 표준적인 ANOVA 방법들은 mixed model 의 특별한 케이스라고 볼 수 있다. 최근에는, mixed model 은 다양하게 응용되었고 확장되어, 다양한 범위의 데이터 상황들에 적용할 수 있게 되었다. 일반화 선형모형 이상의 툴셋을 확장하는데에 첫 걸음으로 볼 수 있다.</p>
<div id="terminology" class="section level2">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>일반인들에게, mixed model 을 둘러싼 용어들은 조금 헷갈릴 수 있다. 이러한 종류의 모형들과 대하여 보게 될 용어들은 다음과 같다:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variance components</li>
<li>Random intercepts and slopes</li>
<li>Random effects</li>
<li>Random coefficients</li>
<li>Varying coefficients</li>
<li>Intercepts- and/or slopes-as-outcomes</li>
<li>Hierarchical linear models</li>
<li>Multilevel models (implies multiple levels of hierarchically clustered data)</li>
<li>Growth curve models (possibly Latent GCM)</li>
<li>Mixed effects models</li>
</ul>
<p>이 모두는 mixed model 의 다른 종류를 말한다. 어떤 용어들은 역사가 깊고, 어떤 것들은 특수 분야에서 자주 사용되고, 어떤 것들은 특정 데이터 구조를 뜻하고, 어떤 것들은 특수한 케이스들이다. <em>Mixed effects</em> 혹은 mixed model 은 일반적으로 fixed 와 random effect들이 함께 있는 것을 의미한다. 일반적으로 나는 ‘mixed models’ 혹은 ’random effects models’를 선호하는데, 더 간단한 용어들이고, 특정한 구조를 의미하지 않고, 후자는 다른 용어들이 사용될 때 많은 사람들이 생각하지 않았을 확장적용될 수 있다<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Mixed effects 에 관해서는, <em>fixed effects</em> 는 linear regression model 의 main effect 로서는 약하지만 고루한 용어, 즉, mixed model 에서 random 이 아닌 파트이고, 어떤 문맥에서 <em>population average</em> effect 를 의미한다. Random effect 에 대해서 많은 정의를 듣게 되겠지만, 어떻게 정의되던지 간에 한 관측단위에 특정한 것이다. 이 문서에서는 관측단위가 어떤 그룹화 factor 의 레벨인 경우를 다루지만, 이 경우는 단지 한 예일 뿐이다.</p>

<div id="kinds-of-clustering" class="section level2">
<h2>Kinds of Clustering</h2>
<p>데이터에 하나 이상의 군집이 있을 수 있고 이 클러스터들은 hierachical 해서 다른 클러스터에 포함되어(nested) 있을 수 있다. 학생들이 여러번 응시한 수학능력시험(SAT) 가 그런 예이다 (학생들 내에 반복된 관측값들이 포함되어 있고, 학생들은 학교 안에 포함되었고, 학교는 학군 내에 포함되어 있다). 포함하지 않는 구조도 있다. 참가자들이 같은 업무를 수행하는 반응시간 실험이 예이다. 관측값들은 개인 내에 포함되어 있지만, 관측값들은 또한 업무유형에 따라 클러스터를 이룬다. 이러한 시나리오를 구분짓기 위해 <em>겹침(nested)</em> 과 <em>crossed</em> 라는 용어가 사용되기도 한다. 또한, 클러스터는 균형을 이룰 수도 있고 아닐 수도 있다. 실험에서는 균형 클러스터가 많겠지만, 아닌 경우도 있다. 예를 들어, 지리적 단위가 클러스터이거나 관측값이 사람인 경우이다.</p>
<p>아래에서 우리는 이러한 데이터 상황들에서 mixed effect model 을 살펴볼 것이다. 일반적으로 우리는 클러스터링이 모델보다는 데이터의 특성이라는 접근법을 취할 것이다. 그러나, 중요한 점은 mixed model 은 유연해서 다양한 데이터 상황을 다룰 수 있다는 점이다.</p>

<h2>Random Intercepts Model</h2>
<p>이후부터는 mixed model 중 가장 간단하고<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> 가장 자주 일어나는 케이스인 random effect 의 그룹화/군집 구조가 하나인 케이스를 살펴볼 것이다. 이를 <em>random intercepts model</em> 이라고 부르는데, 이유는 곧 알게 될 것이다.</p>
</div>
<div id="예-학점-gpa" class="section level2">
<h2>예: 학점 (GPA)</h2>
<p>지금부터 우리는 대학 학점을 예측하는 요소를 조사할 것이다. 200 명의 학생을 각각 여섯 번 평가했다 (처음 3년간 모든 학기). 관측값들은 학생 내에서 클러스터되어 있다. 취업상황, 성별, 고등학교 학점과 같은 변수들도 있다. 이들 중 일부는 라벨되어 있고 수치형 형태로 되어 있다. 자세한 내용은 <a href="appendix.html#appendix">appendix</a> 을 참고하라.</p>

<h2>일반적인 회귀 모형</h2>
<p>기본모형을 여러 방법으로 표현할 수 있다. 첫번째로는 표준 회귀부터 시작해서 방향을 잡아본다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>절편과 시간효과를 위한 계수들 (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) 이 있다. 오차 (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>) 는 평균 0 이고 어떤 편차 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> 를 가지는 정규분포를 이룬다고 가정한다 .</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \sigma)\]</span>
또 다른 방법인, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gpa}\)</span> 데이터 생성과정을 강조하는 모델은 다음과 같이 쓸 수 있다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} \sim \mathscr{N}(\mu, \sigma)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\mu = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion}\]</span>
GPA 와 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> 변수는 각 관측값을 나타내는 첨자를 생략했지만, 한 시점에 한 개인에 관한 모델이라고 생각할 수 있다.</p>

<div id="초기-모델" class="section level3">
<h3>초기 모델</h3>
<p>이제 우리는 각 학생들마다 고유한 효과를 포함하는 mixed model 로 설명하는 방법을 보일 것이다. 한 학생에 대해 다음 모형을 살펴보자.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> 이는 학생에 특수한 효과, 즉, 주어진 학생이 GPA 에서의 변인은 분산 원인으로 볼 수 있다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + (\mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}} + \epsilon)\]</span>
학생 효과에 대해 (관용적으로) 다음을 가정할 수 있다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}} \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \tau)\]</span></p>
<p>따라서 학생효과는 랜덤한데, 구체적으로는 평균 0 과 측정된 표준편차 (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>) 를 갖는 정규분포를 이룬다. 다른 말로 하면, mixed model 과 표준 회귀 사이의 개념적 차이는 학생 효과 뿐인데, 평균적으로 효과는 없지만 일반적으로 평균적으로 <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> 값이 학생마다 차이나는 것이다.</p>
<p>다시 정리하면, 오차의 추가 소스보다 모델 계수들이 강조된다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = (b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}}) + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} +  \epsilon\]</span>
더 간단하게 하면:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} +  \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>우리는 학생고유의 절편을 갖게 되는데, 구체적으로는 학생 각자가 전체 절편에 고유 효과가 더해지게 되어, 각 사람마다 다른 절편을 갖게 된다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} \sim \mathscr{N}(b_{\mathrm{intercept}}, \tau)\]</span>
이제 절편이 평균이 전체 절편이고 어떤 표준편차를 가지는 정규분포를 이루는 것을 보았다. 이를 종종 <em>랜덤 절편(random intercepts)</em> 모델이라고 부른다.</p>
</div>
<div id="multi-level-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Multi-level model</h3>
<p>mixed model 을 표현하는 다른 방법은 흔히 <em>multilevel 모델링</em> 논문에서 볼 수 있다. 두 개의 파트 회귀 모형으로 더 명시적으로 표현할 수 있는데, 한 파트는 관측값 레벨과 다른 파트는 학생 레벨이다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span>
하지만, 두번째 레벨부분을 첫번째에 ‘넣으면’ 이전 것과 동일하게 된다.</p>
<p>우리는 학기마다 학생에 특수한 효과를 갖지 않는다는 것을 주목하라. 이러한 배경에서, 학기는 <em>fixed effect</em> 만 갖고, 랜덤 파트는 없다고 말한다. 항상 이래야만 하는 것은 아닌데, 나중에 볼 것이다.</p>

<p>이는 절편이 의미하는 시작시점에서, 즉 학기가 0 일 때 평균 학점이 2.6 임을 보여준다. 또한, 학기가 진행됨에 따라, GPA 가 약 0.11 점 만큼 증가함을 알 수 있다. 우리가 군집을 무시한다는 점을 제외하고는 큰 문제가 생기지 않는다. 이렇게 하는 것의 단점은 표준오차가 편향되고 따라서 이를 기반으로 한 통계적 유의성에 관한 주장은 잘못되기 쉽다는 점이다. 하지만 더 중요한 점은 바로 우리의 관심사인 학생 효과를 탐색할 수 없다는 점이다.</p>

<h3>Regression by cluster</h3>
<p>다른 방법은 각 학생마다 독립된 회귀를 실행하는 것이다. 하지만, 여기에는 많은 단점들이 있다 - 그룹이 많고, 각 군집 내에 요약할 만한 데이터가 매우 적을 때 (이 경우에 해당한다) 쉽게 요약되지 않고, 그리고 모델들이 over-contextualized 된다는 점인데, 이는 학생들이 공통으로 가지고 있는 것을 무시함을 의미한다. 우리는 뒤에서 이러한 방법을 mixed model 과 비교할 것이다.</p>

<p>학기가 모든 학생들마다 변하지 않고 일정하다고, 즉, <em>fixed</em> effect 라고 가정했었다.</p>
<p>우리는 이러한 효과들에 매우 관심이 있고, 이에 관한 불확실성에 관해 알고 싶다. <span class="pack">lme4</span> 에서 bootstrapping 을 통해 할 수 있는데, 구체적으로는 <span class="pack">lme4</span> 안에 있는 <span class="func">bootMer</span> 함수로 수행할 수 있다. 일부 독자에게는 약간 복잡한 작업일 수 있다. <span class="pack">merTools</span> 패키지의 <span class="func">predictInterval</span> 함수<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>는 쉬운 방법을 제공한다. 바로 이들이 제공하는 플롯을 보자.</p>

<h2>Cluster Level Covariates</h2>
<p>Mixed model 을 multilevel 모델로서의 해석을 살펴보자.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span>
예를 들어 성별과 같은 학생레벨의 covariate 을 모델에 추가한다면, 다음과 같이 된다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{sex}\cdot \mathrm{sex} +  \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span>
집어 넣은 다음 우리는 전과 같은 모델에 설명변수들이 추가된 형태가 된다.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion}+ b_{sex}\cdot \mathrm{sex} + (\mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}} + \epsilon)\]</span>
따라서, 클러스터 레벨 covariate 을 추가한다고 해서, 모델<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>에 이상한 효과가 더해지지 않는다. 이것들을 설명 변수들에 포함시키기만 하면 된다. 관측값 레벨 변수들의 평균이나 다른 요약값으로 클러스터 레벨 covariate 을 만들 수도 있다. 클러스터가 지리적 단위를 대표하고 관측값들이 사람들인 경우 이러한 상황이 매우 자주 생긴다. 예를 들어, 소득을 개인레벨 covairate 으로 갖고, 그 지역의 평균 경제적 수준을 대표하기 위해 중간값을 사용할 수 있다.</p>

<h2>Summary of Mixed Model Basics</h2>
<p>Mixed model 을 이용하면 데이터 안의 군집을 설명할 수 있다. 이러한 이유가 전부라고 하더라도, 데이터의 구조를 무시했을 때 보다 상대적으로 더 정확한 추론을 할 수 있을 것이다. 하지만 그 이상인 것들이 있다. 우리는 목적 변수의 변동 원인을 더 잘 이해한다. 모델의 파라미터의 그룹고유의 추정값을 얻을 수 있는데, 그룹들이 서로 얼마만큼 정확히 다른지를 이해할 수 있다. 더군다나, 그 결과로 그룹 고유한 예측을 하게 해주어, 그룹 때문에 발생하는 변동이 상당하다는 전제하에 훨씬 더 정확한 예측을 할 수 있다. 요약하면, 가장 간단한 상황에서조차 mixed model 로 훨씬 많은 것을 얻을 수 있다.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I actually like <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Richly-Parameterized-Linear-Models-Additive-Time-Series-and-Spatial/Hodges/p/book/9781439866832">Richly Parameterized Linear Models</a>, or <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642343322">Structured Additive Regression Models</a>. Both are a mouthful, but at least the latter reduces to <a href="http://m-clark.github.io/workshops/stars/">STARs</a>.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Actually, the simplest model would have no covariates at all, just <span class="emph">variance components</span>, with no correlations among the random effects. Such a model can be interesting to look at while exploring your data, but would probably never suffice on its own to tell the story you desire to.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Note that I leave out the observation level subscript to keep things clean. I find that multilevel style notation quickly becomes unwieldy, and don’t wish to reproduce it. It also tends to add confusion to a lot of applied researchers starting out with mixed models.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This will not always be the case, e.g. with unbalanced data, but they should be fairly close.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The standard error for our time covariate went down due to our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> being lower for this model, and there being no additional variance due to cluster membership.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Note that many common modeling situations involve a fuzzy p setting, but especially penalized regression approaches such as mixed, additive, ridge regression models etc. Rather than be a bad thing, this usually is a sign you’re doing something interesting, or handling complexity in an appropriate way.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>See <code>?confint.merMod</code> for details and options. The output you see is based on my wrapper <code>mixedup::extract_vc</code>.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>These are sometimes referred to as BLUPs or EBLUPs, which stands for (empirical) best linear unbiased prediction. However, they are only BLUP for <em>linear</em> mixed effects models. As such you will also see them referred to as <span class="emph">conditional mode</span>. Furthermore, in the Bayesian context, the effects are actually estimated as additional model parameters, rather than estimated/predicted after the fact.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Note that while <span class="func">predictionInterval</span> does not quite incorporate all sources of uncertainty as does <span class="func">bootMer</span>, it’s actually feasible for larger data sets, and on par with the Bayesian results (e.g. with <span class="pack">rstanarm</span>).<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Note that the default plot from <span class="pack">merTools</span> is confusingly labeled for single random effect, because it unnecessarily adds a facet. You’ll understand it better by looking the plot in the discussion of <a href="extensions.html#cross-classified-models">crossed random effects</a> later. However, the one displayed is from my own package, <a href="https://m-clark.github.io/visibly">visibly</a>.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This is why the multilevel depiction is sub-par, and leads many to confusion at times. You have a target variable and predictor variables based on theory. Whether they are cluster level variables or if there are interactions doesn’t have anything to do with the data structure as much as it does the theoretical motivations. However, if you choose to depict the model in multilevel fashion, the final model must adhere to the ‘plugged in’ result. So if, for example, you posit a cluster level variable for a random slope, you <em>must</em> include the implied interaction of the cluster level and observation level covariates.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
